========================================SDK-UBUNTU========================================
Setup for Ubuntu

download Android Studio or SDK only
install
set PATH
In my case Android and its SDK was installed by default under:

/root/Android/Sdk
Open terminal and edit ~/.bashrc

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

export ANDROID_HOME=/root/Android/Sdk
PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

To refresh your PATH run

source ~/.bashrc

===============================GRADLE-UBUNTU=========================================
Step 1: Update the System

Before installing any packages on your Ubuntu server instance, it is recommended to update the system. 
Login using the sudo user and run the following commands to update the system.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
Step 2: Install JDK

Gradle requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 7 or higher in order to work. In this tutorial we will be installing JDK 8. 
Run the following command to install JDK 8 on your server.

sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk wget unzip
The above command will also install wget and unzip. Verify the installation.

java -version
You will see the following output.

openjdk version "1.8.0_121"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.10.2-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
Step 3: Download Gradle

Gradle distribution archive comes in two types: "binary-only" and "complete". The "binary-only" archive contains the Gradle software only wheres "complete" archive comes with binary, documentation and source.
 Run the following command to download Gradle to your system.

wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.4.1-bin.zip
You can always check the Gradle release page to look for the link to the latest version of Gradle.

Step 4: Install Gradle

Create a directory for the Gradle installation.

sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
Extract the downloaded archive to the newly created directory.

sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-3.4.1-bin.zip
Configure the PATH environment variable so that the gradle executable can be directly executed anywhere on the system.

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-3.4.1/bin
You can run the following command to check if the Gradle install was successful.

gradle -v
